// This service completely hides the data store from the rest of the app.
// No other part of the app knows how the data is stored. If anyone wants
// to read or write data, they have to go through this service.

// For this starter code, we use mock data, that is, data in memory that
// is pretty arbitrary. The service functions to create and fetch articles
// will just work on this fake data in memory.

// This intent is for you to fork this starter code and then replace the
// bodies of the service functions with code that fetches from a *real*
// database like Firebase Firestore.
